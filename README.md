# waldo

A photo tagging game where players can race against the clock to pick characters out of a crowd, like a page in a Where's Waldo book.  

Meant to demonstrate a solid grasp on using Rails as a backend API for a React app.  
Part of The Odin Project: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/where-s-waldo-a-photo-tagging-app-javascript  

Uses Rails 5.2, React, PostgreSQL and Webpacker.
